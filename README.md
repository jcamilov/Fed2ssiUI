Hi Isaac.

### `running the app`

To run it:
"npm run start" or simply "npm start" from the project's directory.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `json templates for policies`

You can change the json file /src/config/templates.json to try different templates.

Just follow the same structure to add or change policy templates and the UI will update accordinlgy.


### `install dependencies`
If the app doesn't run, install dependencies manually.

The app has been tested and runs ok with following versions:
- npm: 8.19.2
- node: v16.18.0 

1. Make sure npm and node are installed

2. (optional) Install "create-react-app" tool

3. Install tailwindcss
Go directly to step on guide in this webpage [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app]https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

4. Install daisyui (this is just for making it look better in the future):
npm i daisyui
